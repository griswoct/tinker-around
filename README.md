# Tinker Around
A collection of random stuff I've made as I learn. This is my playground where I tinker with new ideas.

I have chosen to make this repository publically accessible in casee it may be of some use to others on their coding journey. However, this is essentially a miscellaneous collection of projects I've come up with as I experiment with new methods or ideas - anything in this repo is likely half-baked and buggy.
