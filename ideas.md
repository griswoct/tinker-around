# Ideas:

* Sorting algorithm
* ~~Guessing game~~
* Timer
* ~~Autofill approved TRs~~ (work)
* Scan new TRs and advise
* Create TR meeting invite
* Scan TR revisions and summarize
* Pull data from the web (temp/ticker?)
* Fork overload
* Dead switch
* Bluring/unbluring algorithm
* ~~Sudoku solver~~
* Spaghettification (generate obfuscation)
* Yellowstone Permutation:
  * [Numberphile: Yellowstone Permutation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUaqiM1bGX4)
* Printer program
* 3-D printer program
* CNC machine program
* Trajectory tracking (triangulation?)
  * Calculate friction losses
  * Accept/calculate different g values
  * Factor density through inertia to drag ratio
  * Initial velocity or freefall start
  * Start with 2-D, but written for future 3-D
