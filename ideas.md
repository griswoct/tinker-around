* Play Tic-Tac-Toe
* Play [Super Tic-Tac-Toe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Na3a1ZrX7c)
* Play Checkers
* Move Chess pieces in legal moves - use official Chess notation for input
* Sun position prediction based on location and datetime (Python?)
  * *Add orbital and rotational periods for planet*
  * Need to account for:
    * Solar noon drift
    * Orbital progression
    * Axial wobble
    * Leap year
    * Standard: axial tilt, orbit, rotation, location, datetime
* Generate word find (VBA)
  * Customizable bad word list
* Word scramble solver
  * Need dictionary file
  * Sort letters alphabetically and compare to dictionary entries of appropriate length
* Frequency Analysis Rating
  * Letter count, avoid `a sin to err`
  * Avoid top words (google 10000)
  * Build "resistant" thessaurus
* Pseudo-word generator
  * Vowel consonant placement
  * Letter frequency and pairing
* Neural network trained to identify specific symbols or letters (Python)
  * License plate scanner
  * "Read" pages of text
    * Book reading robot?
  * Recognize flags
  * Recognize brand logos
  * Find patterns from habits
* Route finder (map navigation)
  * Intersection nodes
  * Distance or time based
  * Random trip mode (random road selection at each intersection)
  * *Use JSON object for each node:*
    `K{H,1200,N;J,800,W;L,600,E;Q,1200,S}`
